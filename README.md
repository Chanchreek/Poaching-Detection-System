# **Poaching Detection System using AI**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on developing an **AI-powered system** to detect poaching activities in real-time. The system leverages **facial recognition** to identify individuals involved in illegal hunting, using **YOLO** for object detection and **OpenCV** for facial recognition. The data captured by camera traps is processed using edge devices and is stored in a backend developed with **Java**.

The ultimate goal is to help conservation efforts by providing an **automated system** to monitor and prevent poaching in wildlife sanctuaries.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses camera traps with facial recognition to identify individuals involved in poaching.
- **YOLO Integration**: Utilizes YOLO (**You Only Look Once**) for fast and efficient object detection.
- **Facial Recognition with OpenCV**: Detects faces from the images and matches them against known individuals.
- **Edge AI**: Deploys on devices like Raspberry Pi or Nvidia Jetson to process data locally.
- **Java Backend**: Stores captured images and related metadata in a secure backend built using Java.

## **Motivation**
Poaching is a major threat to wildlife and has devastating effects on **biodiversity** and **ecosystems**. Current methods of poaching detection are often delayed and require manual intervention. This system aims to:
- Automate the detection process
- Provide **real-time alerts**
- Minimize response time for anti-poaching teams
- Enable long-term data storage and analysis of poaching activity

## **Hardware Requirements**
To deploy the system in the field, the following hardware components are recommended:
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (or **Nvidia Jetson Nano**) as an edge device
- **Camera Module** for capturing images in the field
- **ESP32 CAM** for basic image capture and lightweight processing (optional)
- Battery packs or solar power solutions for remote field deployment

## **Software Architecture**
The system is divided into several key components:
1. **Camera Trap (Edge Device)**: Captures images in real-time and processes them locally.
2. **YOLO & OpenCV Integration**: YOLO is used for object detection, and OpenCV handles facial recognition.
3. **Java Backend**: A backend to store the images, facial data, and metadata of captured individuals.
4. **Image Storage**: Stores recognized faces and their metadata securely in a database.

## **Installation**

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poaching-detection-system.git
cd poaching-detection-system
```

### **Setting up the Environment**

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure the following key dependencies are installed:
   - `opencv-python`
   - `tensorflow`
   - `torch`
   - `pillow`
   - `numpy`

2. **Download Pre-Trained YOLO Weights**:
   You can download YOLOv5 weights by following [this link](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases). Place the weights in the `weights/` folder.

3. **Set Up Java Backend**:
   Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run the following to set up the backend:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   java -jar target/backend-0.1.0.jar
   ```

### **Setting up Raspberry Pi / Nvidia Jetson**
For deploying on edge devices:
1. **Raspberry Pi**:
   - Install TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV on your Raspberry Pi by following [this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python).
   - Deploy your detection models onto the device.
   
2. **Jetson Nano**:
   - Install TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenVINO for optimized performance on Jetson Nano.
   - Transfer the YOLO model and Python scripts to the device for processing.

### **Running the Application**
1. **Run the Poaching Detection System on your local machine**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This script will start capturing images, processing them through YOLO, and performing facial recognition using OpenCV.

2. **Deploy on Raspberry Pi / Jetson**:
   After setting up the software, you can start the camera and detection system using:
   ```bash
   python edge_detection.py
   ```

### **Configuration**
Modify the `config.json` file to set up specific parameters for camera traps, image storage, and detection thresholds.

## **How It Works**

1. **Image Capture**: 
   Camera traps installed in the field capture images of potential poachers.
   
2. **YOLO Detection**: 
   The YOLO model detects human faces from the images, marking them as potential poachers.
   
3. **Facial Recognition**: 
   OpenCV processes the faces for recognition, matching them with a known dataset of individuals.

4. **Data Storage**: 
   The backend system stores the images and related metadata in a secure database for future analysis.

5. **Alerts**: 
   Real-time alerts can be configured to notify conservation teams of detected poachers, enabling rapid response.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Improved Model Accuracy**: Fine-tune the YOLO model with more training data specific to poaching activities.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Integrate with cloud services like AWS or Azure for real-time notifications to anti-poaching teams.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast potential hotspots for poaching activities.
- **Drone Integration**: Utilize drones with real-time object detection to cover larger areas for monitoring poachers.
